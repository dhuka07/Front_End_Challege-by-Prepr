# Front_End_Challege-by-Prepr
MY task is to redesign a few key pages of the Prepr Network.

Reimagine and create frontend webpages of the following pages (and possible sub-pages):

Explore page (https://preprlabs.org/)
Projects page (https://preprlabs.org/myProjects)
Challenges page (https://preprlabs.org/list/challenge)
Challenge details page (https://preprlabs.org/challengeManager/front-end-developer-work-challenge)

I have successfully created it!
